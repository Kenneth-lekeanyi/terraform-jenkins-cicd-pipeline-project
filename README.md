# Terraform-Jenkins-CICD-Pipeline-Project

# DEPLOYING INFRASTRUCTURE USING THE CI/CD JENKINS PIPELINE


- Best practices actually says that we should avoid deploying infrastructure locally or manually using those terraform commands like `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply` and `terraform destroy`.
- So, Best practices wants us to make use of **Automation** to deploy infrastructure. Meaning that we should make use of an **Automation Pipeline** to deploy infrastructure. Therefore, we would make use of the Jenkins Pipeline process to deploy our infrastructure in an Automated way or process using the **Pipeline Script**
- Note that, we have Cloud Build within Google Cloud that we can use to also automate the pipeline just like Jenkins. Any CI tool can be used here like **Bamboo**, etc
