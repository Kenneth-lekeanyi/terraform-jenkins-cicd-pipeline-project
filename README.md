# Terraform-Jenkins-CICD-Pipeline-Project

# DEPLOYING INFRASTRUCTURE USING THE CI/CD JENKINS PIPELINE


- Best practices actually says that we should avoid deploying infrastructure locally or manually using those terraform commands like `terraform init`, `terraform plan`, `terraform apply` and `terraform destroy`.
- So, Best practices wants us to make use of **Automation** to deploy infrastructure. Meaning that we should make use of an **Automation Pipeline** to deploy infrastructure. Therefore, we would make use of the Jenkins Pipeline process to deploy our infrastructure in an Automated way or process using the **Pipeline Script**
- Note that, we have Cloud Build within Google Cloud that we can use to also automate the pipeline just like Jenkins. Any CI tool can be used here like **Bamboo**, etc

# IMPLEMENTATION
# 1) set up the Repositories
- Sign into your Github Account
- Now, download this template or code from this repository into your Local. **terraform-jenkins-cicd-pipeline-project**
- It has these files
  - **Archieve (Folder)**
  - **Installations (Folder)**
  - **Jenkinsfile (File)**
  - **Main.tf (File)**
  - **Provider.tf (File)**
  - **Variable.tf (File)**
  - **terraform.tfvars (File)**
- you can just download the zip file, then copy from your Downloads into your local repo.
- Now, go to your Company's github Account and create a New Repository.
- Name it as **terraform-jenkins-cicd-pipeline-project**
- Make it public if you like
- Add a README.md file
- Then create the Repository
- Now, clone this repository. So, copy the cloned URL under HTTPS using the clipboard
- Then, go to your local or VS Code and clone it there by doing **git clone <paste the cloned URL here> and enter to clone it.

- 
- Now, since the template will be in my Remote GitHub Account,
- open the **terraform-jenkins-cicd-pipeline-project** Repo in my GitHub Account
- Then click on the Green botton "Code"
- Now, click on "Download zip" so as to download it into your Downloads in your company's local.
- If its a Mac, it will automatically unzip it. But if its a Windows, you have to click on "Extract" to be able to unzip it.
- a Folder will appear. you can now go into the folder, click and drag it
- Make sure that **terraform-jenkins-cicd-pipeline-project** is highlighted in your V.S Code
- Then open your Finder in another screen, click on the unzip **terraform-jenkins-cicd-pipeline-project** that you have downloaded to your "Downloads" to open it.
- Double click to actually open the file inside.
- Then do `command + A` to actually highlight all the Folders and Files within it (Since we are transfering but those Folders and Files.)
- Now, drag all the Folders and Files into the cloned Repo in your V.S inside the **terraform-jenkins-cicd-pipeline-project** that you cloned from your company's GitHub Account
- If it ask you to replace also the README.md, just accept it.
- We shall then do all the changes that we want here and push it to the Company's GitHub Repo
- 
# 2) Commit the local Changes to your GitHub Repository
- Now, cd into that repository by doing
- `cd terraform-jenkins-cicd-pipeline-project`
- Now, push it to your gitHub by doing
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "added pipeline automation script"
  - git push
- Now, go to the Company's GitHub Repo and open the Repo to ensure that those Files and Folders (The code) is there.
-  # SUCCESS

- Now, go back to your v.s code and click to open the **Jenkinsfile** which is inside of this Repository. You will see all the terraform stages carrying those terraform commands inside the Jenkinsfile, plus some additional terraform setup like "Manual Approval", "Slack Notification", "terraform version", and some colour definition. Then the resource configurations are seated inside the main.tf. so everything appears as follows.
- So when you execute this Pipeline and maybe you come after to add the resource, you just go to Main.tf and add any resource that you want to add, and then you commit it to GitHub using those git commands, and immediately it lands on GitHub, the pipeline will automatically picks it up and run it.
- You will then only need to go into the Manual Approval Stage or the Manager will go in there and manually approve it. And immediately he manually approves it, the resource automatically get deployed or provisioned in the console or in the environment that is targeted.

- So, the second layer of Manual Approval is very very important. Because it will improve the quality of the product, leading to efficiency there. {Because, if the Engineer doesnt pick up the error, the Release Manager or the Manager or whosoever that is reviewing the code will surely pick up the error or the bug}.

- Now, as we have set up the jenkins Pipeline script, our main.tf is carrying the resources, we now need to commit the changes and push it to GitHub. So do
- And we are assuming that the infrastructure is just this VM Instances inside the main.tf
- But there could be thousand resources inside this Main.tf alone. AND we shall deploy it now and later the Manager called kENNETH to add additional resources which we shall add it later.
- Now, go to **Provider.tf** and in line 17, update the project ID there. SO, go copy the Project ID of your Environment where you want the resources to get deployed there and come and replace it with the **Project ID** that is there now.
- Now, go back to the Jenkinsfile. And there in the last lines where you have "Post Section", there is a Slack Channel that is needed. This is a channel that habours all the members of the team. So you need to update this channed in Line 56.

# 3) Create a Slack Notification Channel
- To create a Slack Channel, follow this procedure;
- First, we need to follow or get into this Workstation. So use the link to get into that Worksatation where you can then create a slack channel or Account for your team
- https://join.slack.com/t/jjtechtowerba-zuj7343/shared_invite/zt-24mgawshy-EhixQsRyVuCo8UD~AbhQYQ

- When you click on it, you will see this pop up. **See what Realworld-cicd-Pipeline-projects is up to**
- Click on "Continue with Google".
- Select any Gmail Address that you have Access to it.
- then click on "Continue"
- Then click on Create Account"
- Now, click on "Open Link" or if you see something like "Open slack App", you can click on it as well.
- If you see it says "Not Supported", try to use another Browser. By copy the link and paste in another Browser like Chrome.
- Now, on this Workspace, we have to create your own Slack Account for your team. So

- At the top left of this Workstation, you will see the name appear there as **Realworld-cicd-pipeline-project**
- Just below it, locate and click on Add Channel".
- Then on the pop up, click on "Create a new channel".
- Name of the channel: **KL123-terraform-cicd-alerts**
- Then click on "Next"
- Visibility: PUBLIC, or Private [select **Private**]  {But you can keep it public so that other people can see and join it}
- Then click on "Create" to create the channel
- Enter email: Add email of whoever you want him to join and be part of the team **OR** you can skip if you dont want them to join
- **Now, the channel or Account has been created**

- Now, copy the name of the channel which is **KL123-terraform-cicd-alerts** and go paste it in the Jenkinsfile (in the V.S Code) line 56 to replace the one that is there. Leave the pound. Dont remove the #.
- So, any alert (whether success or failure), will be sent to this channel where all team members are part of it.
- Now, commit the changes and push. So while inside **terraform-jenkins-cicd-pipeline-project**, do
  - git add .
  - git commit -m "updated configuration files"
  - git push

- Now, there are few things we still need to do at the level of Slack. So go back to Slack (i.e to the **KL123-terraform-cicd-alerts** channel)
  - Below the search bar at the top (I.e immediately above messages, you have your name of the channel there. click on that name carrying a small lock by the side
  - **KL123-terraform-cicd-alerts**
- A page will pop will pop up in the middle, Locate and click on "Integration"
- (So to integrate slack and jenkins, we need to generate a token in slack that we would hand it over to jenkins for them to integrate with each other). So its this token that will provide jenkins access slack.
- Then, under "Apps", locate and click on "Add an App".
- On the "Add Apps to **KL123-terraform-cicd-alerts** page that pops up, locate "Jenkins" and click on "View", which is beside it.
- Then click on "**Configuration**"
- Now, click on "Add to slack".
- On the "Post to channel section that comes up, use the drop down to select **KL123-terraform-cicd-alerts**.
- Then click on "Add Jenkins CI integration".

- Now, these are the various steps that you have to follow to set up the integration. But before that,
- Go to step 3 and copy the 2 things in red and save them somewhere handy
  - **Team Subdomain:** `realworldcicdpipeline`  {copy this highlighted realworldcicdpipeline and paste somewhere in your Note pad. It is your Workspace ID}
  - **Integration Token Credential ID:** Create a secret text credential using `pz99Tu/onFu710v12wecBnnt` as a value. Copy the highlighted value and save somewhere
  - Once you finish copying and keeping them somewhere, scroll down and click on "Save settings" to save it. {You can then leave the apge open}

# 4) Set up a Jenkins Environment that will use it to be able to connect to the Pipeline.
- To set up the Jenkins Environent, first of create a Jenkins Server. so, create an Instance
  - On the console, click on **Create instance**
  - Name: **jenkins-cicd-deploy-infrastructure**
  - machine type: **e2-standard-4**
  - Operating system and storage
    - Click on "CHANGE"
    - os: **Ubuntu**
    - Version: **22.04 LTS (X86/64)**
    - Size: **30**  {because Jenkins is big}
    - Click on "Select"
  - Under "Security" for SA, give full Access
  - Access scopes
    - Check this box on "Allow full access to all cloud APIs"
  - Our Firewall Rule for Port 8080 Jenkins was already created. So Firewall is fine
  - under Advance
    - Automation: paste this automation script here. It begins from **#!/bin/bash** and end on **sudosnap install terraform** 
      #!/bin/bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo touch /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc
sudo wget -O /etc/apt/keyrings/adoptium.asc https://packages.adoptium.net/artifactory/api/gpg/key/public

- Now, click on "Create".
- Now, log into the instance. So copy the External IP of this newly created Jenkins Server, take it to a New Browser and do 8080 to access Jenkins. So do]
  - 34.45.98.102:8080
  - **Jenkins UI comes up**

# 5) Procceeed to Unlock Jenkins
- Now, copy the path of the password and take it to the Jenkisn server

- Log into the Jenkins instance on V.S Code, you can just use the shell or ssh system. Since this is just a one time login thing, so
  - click on ssh
  - Authorize
  - As it comes up, do
  - `sudo cat <paste the path here>
  - Now, copy the password and take it to the Jenkins UI.
  - Paste the password in the Jenkins Password or addministrator Password box and click on "Continue"
  - Click now on "Install suggested plugins"

- On **Create First Admin User** page that pops up;
  - username: **admin**

  - Click now on **Save** and **Continue**
  - Then click on **Save** and **Finish**
  - Then click on **Start using Jenkins**
 
  - **WELCOME TO JENKINS**
  - On this Welcome to Jenkins page that pops up,
  - Now we are going to install the Slack plugins that will be used for that integration with other tools like `Terraform and slack`
  - click now on "Manage Jenkins"
  - Then click on "Plugins"
  - Then locate on the left and click on "Available Plugins"
    - Search for Slack
    - Then check the box against Slack Notification.
